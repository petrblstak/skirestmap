                    Fabulous experience! Arrived before our reservation and relaxed by the outdoor bar looking at the great view of the Chattahoochee River; just beautiful with some fall foliage. Sat outside for dinner; again, beautiful view. Our server was awesome! I wish I remembered her name; she was energetic, fun, and knew her stuff. We were two college roommates reuniting in Atlanta after 30 years and word spread throughout the staff and they all treated us wonderfully. Food was great; we shared the duck prosciutto appetizer which they presented to us on two separate plates. I thought this was a very nice touch. Most restaurants serve on one plate with two small plates to help yourself. This attention to detail made such a difference. My friend had the pork loin special which was delicious. I had the cornmeal crusted trout with Peruvian white beans; perfectly prepared. Really wanted to try the rabbit! But was not feeling that adventurous; next time! Shared the popcorn ice cream sundae for dessert. My friend picked that and I was a bit skeptical but OMG it was just amazing! Perfect combo of sweet and salty served with homemade cracker jack. One of the best desserts I've had. Again, the staff was so friendly; when asking where the restrooms were, they didn't just point and tell me, I was actually escorted to the area - that was a first and, again, another small touch that enhances the whole experience. Highly, highly recommended and I would go back in a heartbeat!
